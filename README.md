# VideoVRD-in-pytorch
The code is written in pytorch and its base is from https://github.com/xdshang/VidVRD-helper. When I want to reproduce those results of this paper-----
Video Visual Relation Detection, some problems emerge. Compared to VidVRD,other baselines in this paper produce worse results but my VTransE's version
produce better results. 
# usage
please read "实验说明.docx" before you use this code and download relative datasets.  
`python main.py --batch_size 64 ...other parameters`
